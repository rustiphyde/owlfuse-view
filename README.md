# OWLFUSE
A social media application for night owls

An idea that started with my capstone project known as **Owull** has evolved into a bigger idea with a new name that is spelled exactly how it sounds. 

It is a social media application for Night Owls. It will incorporate all the functionality of **Owull** in regards to the _Karaoke Lists_, _Drink Recipes_, and _Randomizer Buttons_ but also adds the ability to have a _User Candle_ complete with _user images_, _posts_, _likes and dislikes_, _comments_, _notifications_ and more.

The theme of the content involves the concept of **"Sparks"** which are the posts users create to "spark an interest" in their fellow owls. Users can "light" a spark which any user can then see on their home page in descending order of when the spark was "lit" or posted. Users then have the ability to **"Add Heat"** or **"Remove Heat"** from a spark, similar to like or dislike a post with the subtle difference that a user can gain heat. A spark with heat of 100 or more burns becomes a **"Fire"** which can potentially become **"Infernal"** if it gains enough **Heat** and **"Stokes"**. Stokes are the comments on a post. If a Spark has turned into a Fire every new Stoke adds to the heat count as well. If a Fire has gained 10,000 or more Heat points it becomes "Infernal" and gets added to another page of the hottest topics on OwlFuse. **Fires** that lose too many Heat points and wind up at zero are *Snuffed Out** or deleted. Once a post becomes **Infernal** (10,000 or more heat points) it can no longer be Snuffed Out and can be viewed on a separate page of the hottest topics in order of most heat points.

Notifications about Heat and Stokes come in the form of **"Sizzles"**, which is just a name that fits with the Heat theme. 

Users choose a username or "alias" as soon as they sign up and it becomes their permanent identity on OwlFuse. 

Users sign up with an email address, a password, a confirm password and their username. Users sign in with just their email address and password. If a user forgets their password they can reset it via an email link.
